# Discription

The application contains **3 prominent roles**:

**1.  Admin –** The admin can add or delete restaurants. When any restaurant signs up by filling in the details, the admin gets the request and can decide whether to add the restaurant or not. Similarly, the admin can remove the restaurant. Also, they can view trends and statistics of food items or restaurant popularity based on the data.
**2. Restaurants –** Restaurants can register with Foodverse and add their menus and food items to the app. They serve orders from customers.
**3. Customers –** Customers can view, search, and filter food items. They can add items to the cart and order them. They also can give reviews about food items.

There are **6 features**:

**1. Admin panel -**  Accept the restaurant’s request to sell their food on Foodverse and admin can also delete the restaurant from the Foodverse. Admin will be given an option to do analytics. For example, Admin can see which restaurant has the greatest number of orders and customers from which area are ordering the food most of the time.

**2. Login / Register -** The User registers as a restaurant or customer. Then Do login according to the role.

**3. Search food/Filter Food -** Users will land up after login in successfully. Here they can select the food that is available initially on the page. Otherwise, they can search food of their choice from the search bar.

**4. Order -**  User will land after searching restaurants from the main page. Here they will be given an option to add the dishes of their choice and check out.

**5. Payment -** This is the page that will show the summary of the user's order. That includes the food name, price, and item count of the particular food item. In the end, it will show the total price and total item to be ordered. The payment button will lead to the payment page.

**6. Rate food -** Users will be asked to submit a review about the food they have ordered. They will have a space to submit written reviews and suggestions. Rating will be available to the other users which will allow them to choose a restaurant.
